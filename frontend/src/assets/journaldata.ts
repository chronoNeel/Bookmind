It's the gateway to Middle-earth, full of wonder and peril.\n\nExpectations:\nI expect dragons, dwarves, and epic quests with themes of courage and growth. A lighter tone than its sequel, but still rich in world-building.\n\nWhy I Want to Read It:\nTo experience the roots of modern fantasy. Tolkien's storytelling is legendary, and I want to see how Bilbo's tale sets the stage for greater epics.\n\nGoal:\nRead leisurely, imagine the landscapes, and track how the 'unexpected journey' changes the characters. Maybe draw some scenes or note mythical inspirations.",
